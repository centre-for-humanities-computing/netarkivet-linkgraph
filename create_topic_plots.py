    """
    Produces plot of a link graph with semantic information added.

    Parameters
    ----------
    linkgraph: DataFrame
        Data frame containing edges of a link graph.
        Edge weights should be represented by 'connections'
        and 'semantic_affinity' columns.
    domain_summary: DataFrame
        Semantic summary of domains in a data frame.
        Should contain a 'spread' column.

    Returns
    -------
    Figure
        Plotly network plot.

    Notes
    -----
    Node sizes and node distances represent semantic spread
    and semantic affinity respectively.
    Node colors represent the total number of links of a domain.
    Opacity of edges represent the number of links between two domains.
    Edges are only added between nodes that are connected by the link graph.
